Connext Documentation
===================================

Connext is an infrastructure layer on top of Ethereum that lets Ethereum wallets, applications and protocols do instant, high volume transactions with arbitrarily complex conditions for settlement. Projects that integrate Connext enable users to aggregate their own Ethereum interactions to get more transaction throughput per block.

These docs cover both the background of Connext and how you get started integrating Connext into your Ethereum wallet or application.

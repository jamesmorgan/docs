# Contributing Guide

We value curiosity, enthusiasm, and determination. Anyone who is excited about state channels and our vision is welcome to contribute to Connext. While we're always looking for developers, there are plenty of other ways to contribute through documentation, design, marketing, and even translation. If you're not sure how best to contribute, reach out to a team member and we'll be happy to find a way for you to help out.

Our [documentation](https://github.com/ConnextProject/docs/wiki/Connext-Overview-and-Developer-Guide) includes information on Ethereum and state channels for both part-time and core contributors to the project, while [LearnChannels](https://learnchannels.org) provides a comprehensive introduction to state channel technology.

Feel free to fork our repo and start creating PRâ€™s after assigning yourself to an issue in the repo. We are always chatting on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yKkzZZm), so drop us a line there if you want to get more involved or have any questions on our implementation!

We encourage contributors to:

- Engage in Discord conversations and questions on how to begin contributing to the project
- Open up github issues to express interest in code to implement
- Open up PRs referencing any open issue in the repo. PRs should include:
  - Detailed context of what would be required for merge
  - Tests that are consistent with how other tests are written in our implementation
  - Proper labels, milestones, and projects (see other closed PRs for reference)
- Follow up on open PRs
- Have an estimated timeframe to completion and let the core contributors know if a PR will take longer than expected
- We do not expect all part-time contributors to be experts on all the latest documentation, but all contributors should at least be familiarized with our documentation and LearnChannels.
